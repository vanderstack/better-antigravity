## What is this?

Better Antigravity is both a **VS Code extension** and an **npm CLI tool** that fixes known bugs and adds quality-of-life features to Antigravity IDE.

| Channel | What it does | Install |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Extension** | Auto-applies fixes on startup + chat rename + SDK features | [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/kanezal/better-antigravity) |
| **CLI** | Quick one-off patching via `npx` (no extension install needed) | `npx better-antigravity auto-run` |

> [!NOTE]
> The extension includes everything the CLI does, plus extra features powered by the [Antigravity SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/antigravity-sdk). If you install the extension, you don't need the CLI.

---

## Install (Extension)

Search for **"Better Antigravity"** in the Extensions panel, or install from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/kanezal/better-antigravity).

Manual install:

```bash
antigravity --install-extension better-antigravity-0.4.0.vsix --force
```

On activation the extension will:
1. **Auto-apply the auto-run fix** (silent, no prompt)
2. **Initialize the SDK** for chat rename and future features
3. **Install the integration script** (prompts for reload on first install, auto-reloads on updates)
4. **Suppress integrity warnings** ("corrupt installation" notification silenced automatically)

---

## Install (CLI only)

If you just want the auto-run fix without installing an extension:

```bash
npx better-antigravity auto-run            # apply fix
npx better-antigravity auto-run --check    # check status
npx better-antigravity auto-run --revert   # revert to original
```

Custom install path (if Antigravity is not in the default location):

```bash
npx better-antigravity auto-run --path "D:\Antigravity"
```

---

## Features

### Auto-Run Fix

**The problem:** You set **Settings -> Agent -> Terminal Execution -> "Always Proceed"**, but Antigravity **still asks you to click "Run"** on every terminal command.

**Root cause:** The `run_command` step renderer has an `onChange` handler that auto-confirms when you switch the dropdown, but there's **no `useEffect`** that checks the saved policy at mount time.

```javascript
// What exists (only fires on dropdown CHANGE):
onChange = useCallback(_ => {
    setPolicy(_), _ === EAGER && confirm(true)
}, [])

// What's MISSING (should fire on mount):
useEffect(() => {
    if (policy === EAGER && !secureMode) confirm(true)
}, [])
```

**The fix:** Our patcher adds the missing `useEffect`. It uses **structural regex matching** (not hardcoded variable names) so it works across Antigravity versions.

> For the full root cause analysis, pattern matching explanation, and example output, see **[FIXES.md](FIXES.md)**.

### Chat Rename (Extension only)

Rename conversations to custom titles via the [Antigravity SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/antigravity-sdk) title proxy. Custom titles override the auto-generated summaries in the sidebar.

### Integrity Check Suppression (Extension only)

When the SDK patches workbench.html, Antigravity shows a sticky "Your installation appears to be corrupt" warning with no dismiss button. As of v0.4.0, the extension automatically updates the checksum in `product.json` after patching so IntegrityService sees `isPure = true`. No warnings on next restart.

Multiple SDK-based extensions are coordinated automatically -- the original checksum is restored only when the last extension uninstalls.

### Status Command (Extension only)

`Ctrl+Shift+P` -> **"Better Antigravity: Show Status"** to see:
- SDK initialization state
- Language Server connection
- Integration script status
- Auto-run fix status per file

---

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Better Antigravity: Show Status` | Show extension and fix status |
| `Better Antigravity: Revert Auto-Run Fix` | Restore original files from backup |

---

## Safety

- **Automatic backups** -- original files saved as `.ba-backup` before patching
- **One-command revert** -- CLI `--revert` or extension command
- **Non-destructive** -- patches only add code, never remove existing logic
- **Version-resilient** -- structural regex matching, not hardcoded variable names
- **Async I/O** -- file operations don't block the extension host

---

## Compatibility

| Antigravity Version | Status |
|---------------------|--------|
| 1.107.0 | Tested |
| Other versions | Should work (dynamic pattern matching) |

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build              # Compile extension
npm run watch              # Watch mode
npm run package            # Build VSIX -> out/
npm run publish:ovsx       # Publish to Open VSX (reads .env)
```

The extension depends on [antigravity-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/antigravity-sdk) from the monorepo sibling directory. The build script aliases it automatically.

Found another Antigravity bug? Have a fix? PRs are welcome.

### Adding a new fix:

1. Create a folder under `fixes/` with a descriptive name
2. Include a `patch.js` that supports `--check` and `--revert` flags
3. Use structural pattern matching, not hardcoded variable names
4. Update this README's feature table
